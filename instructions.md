### **4. Non-functional Requirements**

- **Performance**:

  - The application should load within three seconds on standard broadband connections.
  - Optimize PDF text extraction to complete within 5 seconds for a 10MB file.

- **Scalability**:

  - Support scaling to accommodate increased user load without performance degradation.
  - Use a cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., Vercel, AWS) for auto-scaling capabilities.

- **Security**:

  - Implement secure file uploads and data storage practices.
  - Ensure user data is encrypted both in transit (TLS) and at rest (AES-256).
  - Regularly audit the application for vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10).

- **Accessibility**:
  - Ensure the application is WCAG 2.1 compliant for accessibility.
  - Provide keyboard navigation and screen reader support.

**Aside**: Added accessibility as a non-functional requirement to ensure inclusivity. Also included specific performance benchmarks for PDF processing.
